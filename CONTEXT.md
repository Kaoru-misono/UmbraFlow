# UmbraFlow

A strictly-background personal game automation app: a C++ host observes a game
window, recognizes annotated pages, and delivers provable background actions;
task scripts written in Luau drive the loop through a minimal capability API.

## Language

### Scripting

**Capability namespace (`umbra`)**:
The single read-only global root through which a task script reaches every
host capability (observation, recognition, pages, actions, waiting). A script
sees nothing of the host outside this root.
_Avoid_: `bot` (superseded draft wording in the grill decisions and the S0
annotation design), `uf` (the C++ namespace, unrelated to the script surface)

**Task**:
One automation flow (such as a game's daily routine) authored as a Luau
script and executed by the host in its own isolated VM against one target
window. A task always belongs to exactly one project and is addressed by its
name within that project, never by a loose file path.
_Avoid_: script (the source artifact a task is written in, not the unit of
execution), job, macro

**Project**:
Everything the host needs to automate one game target: the authoring
document, source screenshots, the generated runtime recognition assets, and
the tasks written against them.
_Avoid_: workspace, profile

### Runtime

**Engine session (`engine::EngineSession`)**:
The stateful engine capability scope that owns one loaded recognition runtime,
one frame source, one action sink, and one trace sink. It vends observations
and authorizes actions for one bound target. The name describes the lifetime
of that capability bundle; it does not imply that the object has a
`CaptureSessionId`.
_Avoid_: engine run (would conflate the capability scope with execution
identity and `EngineRunId`), capture session

**Capture session identity (`CaptureSessionId`)**:
The outer component of frame identity. Together with `TargetGeneration` and
`FrameId`, it prevents evidence from distinct capture sessions from
colliding. It is supplied by the composition root and belongs to captured
frames, not to `engine::EngineSession`.
_Avoid_: `SessionId` (too generic), engine session id, task session id
